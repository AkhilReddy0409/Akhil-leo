John and Megan have three sons - William, David, and Adam. The wives of William, David, and Adam are Emma, Olivia, and Lily respectively. William and Emma have two children - Chris and Stephanie. David and Olivia have five children - Wayne, Tiffany, Julie, Neil, and Peter. Adam and Lily have one child - Sophia. Based on these facts, we can create a program that can tell us the name of Wayne's grandfather or Â Sophia's uncles are. Even though we have not explicitly specified anything about the grandparent or uncle relationships, logic programming can infer them.
